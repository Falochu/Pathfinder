\notesection{Events}
27 Jan 2015
 Six months ago, the Royal Scouts of Rhyradon set out to take a look at the island of Kerrhylon. Though they lose several members to the dangerous place, they return with exciting news: they believe that with some concerted effort, the Northern Commonwealth could in fact establish a foothold in the area, and that it has a wealth, both physical and cultural, ready for rediscovery. Their report is the pivotal moment in the plan that has been in motion for a year at least. The Northern Commonwealth's member-states have an uneasy alliance, especially given the human kingdom, Rhyradon's expansionist tendencies. To stay together, they require a common goal, and exploring (and importing the wealth from, presumably) the ancient island is that goal.\\

 We begin in early Spring in the port city of Helarn, Rhyradon. There, the young son of Archlord Tamarlain has been put in charge of a much larger expedition, 8 cogs, carracks, and hulks, heavily-laden with soldiers and supplies establish an outpost and survive for six months or more. Various nobles have provided funding for the expedition, in hopes of a return on their investment, but few of the general citizenry seem happy with such a young, untested noble being given the reins of such a politically important mission. Our group arrives at Helarn to apply for the expedition, each for our own reasons, but all manage to pass the high bar to entry into the limited space. We head toward the Speedwell, a carrack that is to be our home for the trip, but are rebuffed by the captain, a short-tempered, deeply prejudiced man who refuses to allow Kallista and Erevan to board.

3 Feb 2015\\
After being refused accommodations aboard the Speedwell, Darvel leads our group to the Sword Royale, whose captain, fortunately, does not hold the same prejudices toward those of scaly or dark skin. This captain, Lokan, does however demand we ``cause no trouble'', and sets Darvel as the responsible party for ensuring our cooperation.

We set out toward Kerrhylon. Erevan hides below deck and away from the sun, but the others have ample opportunity to meet some of the crew and passengers: Connor, the chipper half-elf bard we observed in conversation from the dock, Audrei, the scatterbrained arcanist of Lord Tamarlin's court, and Bridget Cloverdown, leader of the Royal Scouts. From Bridget's account, our destination is swarming with orcs, goblinoids, dragon-riding kobolds, and other creatures that were, most likely, responsible for her prior expedition losing nearly half its members. She also relates a wondrous story of a tower reaching hundreds of feet high, ringed with a spiral stair and various long-abandoned shops and the like, centered in the ruined capital city. Balthazar nearly drives Bridget crazy with incessant questions, fascinated by her stories.

On the fifth day of the journey, we pass through a massive storm, making our land lubing selves sick with the rocking. From some distance away, we are able to observe that the storm has a strange, unnatural ring shape to it.

A few days after that, we make land at a port on the island of Kerrhylon, under the watchful gaze of a ominous fort and among the skeletal masts of long-sunken ships stretching skyward from the bottom of the harbor. Lord Tamarlain makes his first appearance, resplendent in untested armor, to observe the landfall, while Bridget, her scouts, and our party board a longboat to row ashore. The beach is eerily silent, but after a few minutes with nothing coming out to meet us, everyone relaxes a bit. Bridget orders the camp set up, and we set up near Connor's campsite, next to a rotting seaside cottage.

Bridget orders us to investigate the lower levels of the fort, while others explore the upper ones, and gives us a Driftglobe to light our way. Connor and his more sombre elven friend, Dest Longmeadows, accompany us. Inside the keep's courtyard, we find a barracks off to one side, and a round, oddly intact armory to the other. Darvel leads the way inside, where we find a rat gnawing a skeletal corpse, but no other signs of life. Huge stained glass scenes depict dragonborn at training, but the barracks itself contains but one weapon, a greatsword locked securely to a weapon rack. It only takes a few extremely painful shocks from touching the thing, and Dest's suggestion none of us can wield it, for us to give up on picking the sword up. We still pilfer it, wrapped safely in a blanket.

Connor finds stairs leading down, and we proceed with our assignment. On a body, Darvel locates a ruby-set golden triangular something, inscribed with the phrase ``glory to the platinum one'' in draconic script. Not ones to leave behind anything potentially valuable, we stash that away, too.

Behind a set of double doors at the bottom of the steps, stands a statue of a dragonborn: the centerpiece to a old, dried out fountain. But before we can examine it or the room further, a goblin springs out brandishing a tiny sword, and is closely followed by a horde of his kind, along with a huge, 7-foot-tall goblinoid. We fight them, but, despite our best effort, lose Kallista to her wounds; the rest of the group suffers grave wounds and/or lose consciousness entirely.\\

10 Feb 2015\\
Kallista wakes to a dragonborn child staring intently, they throw a ball and talk. The child, of clear red-dragon descent, calls herself Akra. She asks Kallista to play, if he doesn't survive. Her father was the ``Kastillian'' here, but couldn't protect her from goblins. The sword we acquired up above, which she calls Illuminescent, was her father's.

Meanwhile, Erevan sees a small head pop up from a secret hatch in the floor. Everan hides while the goblin look through the party's possessions, until Erevan springs up and confronts it. Fawning and crudely attempting Drow speech, the goblin sees to gain our trust, and promises help navigating the complex. Dest returns in a hurry followed by a small, balding, sour priest of Wee Jas who, though irritated that Kallista is dead rather than injured, resurrects Kallista and heals us, but at a price: Kallista's service for a year's duration. The priest, Danid Theric, leaves with instructions for Kallista to meet him later to begin her payment.

Connor suggests we are unprepared to proceed, but Dest pushes for us to continue, after providing a healing potions to each of us. With the goblin, Wretch, in the lead, we head deeper into the fort. The group is distrustful of Wretch, but after he hands over a cache of platinum coins and disarms several traps, we mostly relax. While we proceed down, Darvel opening locks and Wretch disarming traps along the way, Wretch tells the tale of Drow arriving here a year or so ago to take a staff and every platinum coin they could find. After passing through a hall filled with reliefs (which Balthazar records in his sketchbook), we encounter a group of goblinoids, and fight with much better results than our first encounter. We keep some of their weapons, and also locate some jars and vases packed in straw-filled crates. Then, we proceed down another flight of steps, where Wretch reports ``the boss'' awaits.\\

17 Feb 2015\\
The group returns to camp to rest, train, and pick up some more supplies. While there, we determine that the triangle thing we collected is some sort of key (probably to the vault), and Audrei identifies our new magic sword as Illuminescent, a dwarven-made, semi-sentient holy avenger.

Returning to the keep, Bridget flushes out a pair of huge insects, which we fight and defeat.\\

24 Feb 2015\\
Erevan and Garabella arrive just as the fight with the insects ends. Wretch appears from the pipe, we opt to not send Wretch back to Danid Theirc. We approach the armory and bump into Bridget's rangers on their way out...they wonder if we saw any goblins, but we deny it. They report one vault is locked, and that they plan to come back with a ram or something later. We pretend to be there for Balthazar's research and proceed down, find the secret trapdoor that Wretch first appeared from, and call for him. After his arival, we convince him to let us follow him to his lair, where we find a suid of dragonborn-sized plate armor (and take it). Wretch tells Erevan the story of his friend, Weegull, being apprenticed by the last drow visitors, but Erevan declines to take on Wretch.

Proceeding to the vault, we find 3 doors on each side of the hall, only one still closed. Wretch meets us there from some tiny passageway. We use the triangle key on the door, and it opens. In a chest inside the room, we acquire gold, dragonborn trade bars, and some magic items (but agree to turn the coins over to Bridget). We return to camp at the same time as scouts arrive at a full gallop, reporting an army of goblins coming, numbering in the hundreds or even thousands, only a day out. Kallista and Garabella bring goblin corpses back to Danid, but he scoffs at the offer and insists on a "live one". The remainder of the group turns in the gold coins to an accountant who has set up adjacent to lord Tamarlain's tent. Back at Audrei's, we learn the prior owner of the sword was Nadar, a paragon of virtue and justice (likely explaining why none of us can communicate with the sword, or even hold it). 

We plan with Dest to join the defensive lines in the morning.

10 March 2015\\
After an uneasy rest the night before battle, we wake to Dest and Connor buckling armor on grimly. They inform us that regretfully, they have been orders to join Lord Tamarlain's personal guard rather than fighting on the front line. We commiserate over the young Lord's inexperience, but wish them luck and safety.  Cam is a flurry of activity, and soon we join ranks at our assigned area along with some new friends, Bant Cormath, Jim (a bard), and a few regular foot soldiers. After the terror of the goblin horde crashing against our line, little side battles break out, and we defeat our challengers with only one footman casualty. Soon, a horn sounds, and Bridget rides by yelling for us to reform. Kallista and Balthazar work to discreetly stabilize and tie up a dying goblin, while we watch the mounted knights charge down and annihilate the fleeing remnants of the goblin force, decisively ending the battle in our favor. Afterward, Balthazar and Gary help heal the wounded, and the rest of us return to camp, relieved that the danger has passed, for now.

17 March 2015\\
No sign of Connor/Dest back in camp. Kallista brings goblin to Danid Theric, who is as aloof and unappreciative as ever. Balthazar leads the rest of us around camp seeking our missing friends. It takes us awhile, but we eventually find them, returning from Lord Tamarlain's tent. They report moving heir camp closer to the young lord (seeking favor?). Connor slips Darvel a note discreetly. Dest embarassed, Connor amused when we suggest they just don't want to be around us anymore. Darvel's note asks us to meet at the main campfire tonight. Erevan and Kallista stay back as they have trouble blending in, others go. Darvel sits nonchalantly by the fire while the others look out for any trouble. Dest, disguised in a heavy raincoat, sits with Darvel and reports quietly that he and Connor stole, copied, and returned a map to a nearby location: the "Great Pavilion". The whole expedition will head there in 2-3 more days, but if we can head there before, we can have first crack at any discoveries (and treasure!). 

We try to sneak out, but (literally) bump into a guard on the way out. He jokes about us heading out looting, and won't hear our denial (but he doesn't stop us). Walking through abandoned streets, nothing disturbs us, but we feel like we're watched the whole way. A few minutes out, a putrid smell begins blowing from the north, making us nauseous, and upon arriving at the pavilion, we find the floor dug out and bodies strewn about everywhere. Hundreds of half-decomposed goblinoids and others in a mass grave. Just before we are struck by them, Erevan notices a pair of massive centipede-like creatures, and we fight, pulling off victory despite some paralysis issues.

We find a hole in the back of the pavilion, leading to a strangely clean, well-lit hall, ending with two double-doors on either side of a dragonborn statue.  Darvel notices and narrowly disarms a pressure plate trap near the statue, and we proceed through the right door. An unadorned  hall extends 100 feet down and ends with another door.

24 March 2015 \\
Beyond the door we find a round, domed room with large furniture scattered about like a lounge, and banners reading "Therium Academy" in gold lettering on green background.  Several doors lead out from here. The first opens to a massive kitchen with large tools, but devoid of any food; behind the kitchen, a similarly appointed dining hall. The second door leads to a large hall with high ceiling, with circles painted on the floor and racks of staves around the perimeter (a training hall, likely). Using magic detection, we find two of them to be magical in nature, and take them with us. Behind the training hall, is a barracks with large bunks and footlockers, but no signs of habitation. Finally, behind the largest door from the semi-sphere room, which we notice bears a sign reading "Chancellor" in a fading draconic inscription, stand a laboratory of sorts to one side, some sort of enchanting or ritual area to the other, and stairs leading up between the two.

As we look around the area, the door at the top of the stairs opens and a skull wreathed in green fire floats quickly toward us, spraying beams of fire and injuring several of us before we can dispatch it. Left in peace to search the area, we find a few scrolls and potions, along with a wand, cloak, and a pearl with magical auras (later at camp Connor identifies the items). At the top of the stairs, we find a bedroom with a magical four-poster that we discover fully recovers you in only an hour of sleep. After healing from our wounds quickly, we hurry back to camp before our absence is missed. 

31 March 2015 \\
The next morning, Kallista visits Danid's tent and passes a little 'test' by not opting to slit the throat of a sleeping Danid-illusion. Danid reports his tests, contrary to expectation, showed no differences between goblins from this continent and those nearer our home (Kallista decline to ask what has become of the goblins). Danid then tasks Kallista to retrieve a rarer quarry, a spellcasting Kobold.

Bridget arrives and reports her scouts were attacked by some magic-wielding creatures early in the morning, and sends us to pursue them into the sewers, and shows us where to begin on a map. After some argument between Erevan and Bridget, we decide to obey and head out. We enter a sewer grate and descend, and after some exploring, encounter a group of Kobolds, and then a wave of reinforcements, testing our resourcefulness. We have barely time to stabilize and tie up the spell caster Kobold (and relieve it of its wand and magical glass orb) before a third wave approaches.

7 April 2015 \\
The third wave comes led by a tiny black dragon, who barks out repeatedly for the kobolds to kill us, but when we turn our power on the dragon, it seems surprised at the pain (maybe it had never been hurt before?) and flees. Without the dragon's help, we finish off the remaining kobolds, and report back to Bridget. Bridget informs us camp will be moving inland in a day's time; Erevan and Bridget argue again, when Erevan accuses the expedition of being the same sort of mindless slaughter machine as the Drow of the underdark. Kallista returns to Danid with the kobold prisoner in tow; Danid is almost giddy with happiness upon learning he has a new creature to torture to death/study.

14 April 2015 \\
Some party members train up prior to the move, while the rest of us scrape together the entirety of our acquired magical items, coin, and store credit and trade the whole lot (along with a promise of more in the form of alchemical ingredients in the future) for a manual of gainful exercise for Gary. 

Connor reports that he suggested to the high command that we be put on a special mission, and sure enough soon after Bridget arrives with orders "directly from Lord Tamarlain" (which doesn't seem to make her very happy). A ship has been spotted off the coast, not part of our expedition, and we are to follow the coast and report back who is aboard and if they are a threat (rivals from the shattered empire?). Before we set out, Bridget hands over a map showing us where to return, as the camp will move while we are away.

We follow the coast until the beach gives way to rocky, low cliffs. Soon after, we come upon a ship's boat wrecked up on the rocks, and when Balthazar and Darvel swim out to it, they see the ship itself in the distance. We see sharks circling the ship, so Erevan summons an unseen servant to push another rowboat to shore from the ship, and we use it to get out there safely and board. The ship is mostly wrecked, with at first no signs of life (but we do see the flag of Tharazim). Before we can investigate further, we are ambushed by odd humanoid fish-people from below deck, and become embroiled in battle.
