- Lands and settlements from north to south: The wastes, dwarven kingdom, 7 settlements, turnbull, horngrim, givissel.\\
- Aganst \e{Dyson}, \e{Z}'s ritual dagger grants +4 and ignores piercing DR\\
- \e{Globe of Sounding} is a map of the whole world. If the holder names a place, it will appear accurately on the globe and show routes to reach that point. It can to update to the present political or even geographical situation automatically, but only when the area in question has been queried as described.\\

- \e{Concluder} One of the nine swords of legend, each aligned to a particular moral outlook. With an alignment of chaotic good, it stands in contrast to two others we know of, \e{Backbiter} and \e{Retorter}. All of the nine have the capacity to ``get in the last word'' in a fight. (In combat rule terms, they act as +2 longswords, but also grant one additional attack at +4, which acts outside the normal initiative order, at the very end of a round.)\\
- \e{Orb of Blasting} Fires up to 5 bolts of arcing lightning (range 100ft), each dealing d10+2 damage on a touch attack. Firing saps 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20hp of the firer's life force for one through five bolts, respectively.\\\\

- Making potions or scrolls uses caster level * spell level units of supplies. see core book p549 for time needed to make an item.\\
- Smelting unrefined mithril yields 1/3 the weight in usable ingots.\\

\B{10 Feb 2015} We met \e{Lord Falcone} at the \e{Frothy Jugs}, who suggested that trouble is brewing, so mercenary help is in high demand; he also implicated the Oerth family in helping draft soldiers into a Givisselian army.  He asked \e{Z} and \e{SF} to join as mercenaries, but we declined; we instead asked for directions to the Falcone family compound so we could join later (really with indent to investigate).
