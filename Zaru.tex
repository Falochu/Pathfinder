\noindent Lord Duran arrived at the Outpost, gave permission for us to occupy the area. Promised to recommend our service to Lord Kelvin's Knights, as reward for clearing out the local orcs; suggested future work in taking back more orc-controlled areas in the Mountains (who sometimes hire ogres as mercenaries)\\

\noindent At the direction of Ser Bolton, we agreed to escort Gregory Reisling on his way to Baylith, for negotiations between Painswick and Baylith.  Along the way, we encountered Tristan Moonstone and his escort Shattered Fang seeking a temple from Tristan's dreams. We decided to take a day or two to investigate, and did eventually stumble upon the temple.  Inside we found a statue of the ``Prince of Swords''', named ``Sener Vanis'', mysterious iconography depicting 7 swords, and the broken parts of a sword we named, ``Concluder'', which we took back to Gareth for repairs.\\

\noindent After arriving at Baylith, Reisling was attacked by assassins and killed; we begged a local temple for a resurection spell, which they provided for free, putting us in their debt.  Reisling comes back weaker but able to carry on negotiations.  We determined the assassins were from Givissel.  They escape, killing a city guard on the way out.  Whippoorwill follows their tracks south, but we decide not to pursue them further.\\

\noindent Negotiations centered around the ``Thrane Bogs'', a bit of swamppy land owned by the Oerths of Painswick, claimed by Mortimer Thrane of Baylith (after an inter-family marriage gave them some claim).  We investigated to determine why they want a swamp, and found evidence of a green dragon lair and some sort of temple (which there wasn't time to investigate).  We killed a pair of Wyverns on the trip, and hauled back the scales for Trig to work on making armor.\\

\noindent Trig gives Zaru a book, from the library of Lord Givon.  It details the Denoxyan Empire from across the sea, a hugely expansionist culture, and the Empire's fight agains the Estani Barbarians and their ``Sword Coven''. Foreign words \emph{Servain} (prince?) and something possibly meaning "witch" seem connected to the Coven.  May be some connection between this Sword Coven and Gareth's abilities, or with the temple in the forest (of Tristan Moonstone's dreams), or both.  Trig also investigated Miranda's armor, and determined it was made by the armorers of the ``Rikante'' family, and upper-class family of Givissel.\\

\noindent We returned to the Outpost to find it under siege, and tracked troll assailants to a cave, and wipe them out. Inside the cave, we found a vein we later identify as Mithri.\\

\noindent Outpost again attacked, this time by Mercenaries, some bearing the symbol of Azmodeus.  They carried parchment mentioning the ``Dead Man's Arms'' tavern in Horngrim.  After the battle, we took their equipment to town and sold it to the master-at-arms for a large sum of axes.\\

\noindent Zaru recieved a package from Trig of a woodprint of a coat of arms and a knight lying at peace labeled as Ser Dyson Oreth and dated to 800 years ago.  Trig believed it to be his tomb that lies at the center of the hotly-contested Thrane bogs.\\

\noindent We contacted Randall Riley, an expert miner, who determined the ore vein in the old troll cave is Mithiril, and negotiated the rate of 1000gp plus 1.5\% of any profits for extraction, plus a promise to excavate the Outpost's basement for free.\\

\noindent Neville, a Crimson Cloak warned us of the ``Silverfish Bandits'', a group near Turnbull, made up of half-orcs and humans, that was rumored to be have been hired to kill us (by whom and why unknown). Neville also shared rumors of a cult to Azmodeus in Horngrim, and that Givissel was hiring mercenaries from across the sea.\\

\noindent Whippoorwill scouted the road to Horngrim, encounterd a Givisselian caravan under heavy guard, bearing the coat-of-arms of a black candle on a yellow background.  He met Grundle Bolthammer, a dwarf sellsword from Horngrim who joined the Silverfish Bandits, but realized it was bad company, and then was almost killed for trying to leave. She and Whippoorwill returned to the outpost.\\

\noindent Regan learned the new spell Shocking Grasp, and tried to test it on Zaru ``because it's funny''; he progresses as a wizard, but not as a member of non-orcish society.\\

\noindent Randall Riley's excavation of the Mithril is interrupted by the attack of a Golden Gorger, we ran and resolved to return, better prepared.\\

\noindent Grundle offerd to help take on the Gorger in exchange for us providing equipment. We succeed in slaying the gorger by a hairsbreadth, expending numerous charges form our magic items in the process. We salvaged gems and gold from the Gorger's stomach, and take its hide to make into armor.\\

\noindent Randall Riley and crew finished excavating the basement, a 20 by 30 foot area with finished floor and walls, with numerous empty wine racks and casks.  Zaru and Shattered Fang find a hidden door behind a wine rack, wade through a trap without Rogue assistance, and pulled a chest from the bottom of a pit in the next room.  After triggering another trap, we found \emph{Rat's Tooth} inside, a shortsword with a rat's face in the basket hilt.  It is intelligent, and cursed to turn both wielder and targets into were-rats.  \\

\noindent Whippoorwill gave Concluder to Gareth, who seemed confident in his ability to re-forge it while retaining its magical properties. Zaru and Shattered Fang guard the mining operation while the others travel to give Trig the Gorger hide, and to repay the church that resurrected Gregory Riesling, by giving them an enchanted mace. Whippoorwill buys a ruby for Gareth to set in Concluder's hilt. Zaru and Shattered Fang ambushed and killed a half-orc at the mining camp, captured another and interrogated him, revealing that the Silverfish bandits are hiding out at the Seven Swords Temple. Zaru kills the prisoner to save him from suffering, and the two meet back up with the party, and pick up newly completed acid-resistant armor Trig made from the Wyvern hide.  She passes on info that Oerth men-at-arms were sent into the swamp but never returned, and now knights are hunting the dragon (the younger one may have left already).\\

\noindent Neville reported that the mercenaries that were coming for us tried to ambush a Oerth caravan, took heavy losses, and so won't likely be a threat anymore.  He also offered to give us trustworthy contacts in Horngrim, if we decide to go there.\\

\noindent We go to the Seven Swords Temple, and slaughtered the Silverfish Bandits, one Dwarf, possibly not a Silverfish himself, escaped to the road back to Cerena. We pursued him, and encounter two knights of Demair (a Horngrim family) who had taken him captive. The knights, Agee and Gil (brothers), invite Kallus to the tournament taking place soon in Baylith, and agree to turn the dwarf, Darren Daggersheen, over to us.\\

\noindent We questioned Daggersheen, who admits to being a Silverfish and an outcast from Dwarven society, and claimed that someone with the last name ``Garret'' was the one sending the Silverfish out against us from Horngrim and Givissel. He also claimed to be headed to Cerena to meet a human spy (wouldn't give a name).  Other than that, he claimed to have no information, and demanded a trial by the Dwarfs, as he comes from a dwarven noble family.\\

\noindent We went to the tourney in Baylith and participated in all three competitions, but won none of them. Kallus met Samuel Riesling, older brother to our friend Gregory.  Met Dr.\ Bernard Bozzle, the Alchemist who has opened up shop across from Trig; he sells all manner of potions, but something seemed fishy about his operation, not the least of which was that he sells healing potions that do not draw from a divine source.  Trig completed a suit of armor from the Gorger's hide. Back at the Frothy Jugs, Philo's cousin, Figgins, tried to sell numerous magical items to Shattered Fang and Zaru, but they were overpriced and his claims of their power were questionable.\\

\noindent For now, Zaru is considering the scroll of ice storm (400gp) and scroll of mage's sword (500gp), but going to pass on the climbing ring, jumping ring, fire protection ring, vampiric touch want (5000gp), acid orb wand, and delayed blast fireball scroll. Zaru only intends to purchase the two scrolls if he can verify them using \emph{read magic}.\\
