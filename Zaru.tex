\begin{notesection}{Events}
\setlength{\parindent}{\tindent}
\B{[Early Campaign]} At the \e{Frothy Jugs}, a tavern in the Northern town of \e{Cerena}, a group of young adventurous spirits formed a party to go forth into Dwarven territory in the high mountains, and put an end to the terror and banditry that the Orcs have visited upon the local people. The party consisted of \e{Zaru (Z)}, a gnomish wizard from the nearby town of \e{Lindstrom}; \e{Gavin}, an outcast half-elf would-be knight in these predominantly human lands; \e{Whippoorwill (WW)}, a quiet and decisive Ranger of the nearby forest; \e{Hifos}, a mad barbarian from the wastes of the far north; and \e{Wren}, a local cleric.

Following the lead of \e{WW}'s tracking skill, they set out after the latest raiding party, eventually coming across an abandoned Dwarven outpost, where they found the orcs, and killed them.  Inside the main building, they freed three former prisoners: \e{Philo Fixtell}, a halfling bard, \e{Trig (T)}, a halfling leatherworker, and \e{Gareth}, a half-orc blacksmith, with the mysterious skill to produce weapons with magical qualities despite possessing no skill in the arcane arts in any traditional sense.

After resting and resupplying, the adventurers made their way further into the mountains, where they clear out more orcs, an ogre sorcerer, and their beasts. Taking a daring step, \e{Z} freed another prisoner, this one an orc of the tribe itself, though a cowardly, outcast one.  \e{Regan}, a frail (by orcish standards) but intelligent (again, by orcish standards) orc promised loyalty in exchange for protection, and became \e{Z}'s apprentice. Not daring to go any further into the mountain tomb, where likely worse things than orcs lived, the adventurers returned to the Dwarven outpost, and claim it as their own, dubbing it \e{New Middleton (NM)}.

\B{[Sessions prior to August 2012]} \e{Lord Duran} arrived at \e{NM}, gave permission to occupy the area; promised to recommend us to \e{Lord Kelvin}, as reward for clearing out the local orcs; suggested future work in taking back more orc-controlled areas in the Mountains. 

At the direction of \e{Ser Bolton}, we agreed to escort \e{Gregory Reisling} on his way to \e{Baylith}, for negotiations between \e{Painswick} and \e{Baylith}.  Along the way, we encountered \e{Tristan Moonstone} and his escort \e{Shattered Fang (SF)} seeking a temple from Tristan's dreams. We detour to investigate; eventually we stumbled upon the temple.  Inside we found a statue of the ``Prince of Swords'', mysterious iconography depicting 7 swords, and the broken parts of \e{Concluder}, which we took back to \e{Gareth} for repairs.

After arriving at \e{Baylith}, \e{Reisling} was attacked by assassins and killed; we begged a local temple for a resurection spell, which they provided. We determined the assassins were from Givissel. They had already left, killing a city guard on the way out.  \e{WW} found their tracks leading south, but we decided not to pursue.

Negotiations began concerning the \e{Thrane Bog}, a bit of swamp owned by the Thranes of \e{Baylith}, but claimed by the Oerths of \e{Painswick} after an inter-family marriage.  We investigated why they wanted a swamp, and found evidence of a dragon lair and some sort of temple, but didn't have time to determine which if either was important.  We killed a pair of Wyverns on the trip, and hauled back the scales for \e{T} to work on making armor.

\e{T} gave \e{Z} a book, detailing the \e{Denoxian Empire}. It lead us to suspect some connection between a ``Sword Coven'' that was wiped out there a long time ago, and Gareth's abilities. The coven also bears resemblance to the temple of \e{Tristan Moonstone}'s dreams. \e{T} also investigated Miranda's armor, and determined it was made by the armorers of the \e{Rikante family}, of \e{Givissel}.

We returned to \e{NM} to find it under siege. After routing the troll assailants, tracking them to a cave, and wiping them out, we found an ore vein we later identify as Mithril.

\e{NM} again attacked, this time by Mercenaries, bearing the symbol of Azmodeus.  After defeating them, we found they carried a bounty notice from the \e{Dead Man's Arms} tavern in \e{Horngrim}.

\e{T} sent \e{Z} a wood-print of a coat of arms and a knight lying at peace labeled as \e{Ser Dyson Oreth} and dated to 800 years ago.  \e{T} believed it to be his tomb that lies at the center of the hotly-contested \e{Thrane Bog}.

We contacted \e{Randall Riley}, who determined the ore vein in the old troll cave is Mithril, and paid him to extract it for us, as well as excavate the basement of \e{NM}'s keep.

\e{Neville} arrived and warned us that the \e{Silverfish Bandits}, may have been hired to come wipe out \e{NM}.  Neville also shared rumors of a cult to Azmodeus in \e{Horngrim}, and that \e{Givissel} was hiring mercenaries from across the sea.

\e{WW} scouted the road to \e{Horngrim}, encountered a Givisselian caravan under heavy guard, bearing the coat-of-arms of a black candle on a yellow background.  He met \e{Grundle Bolthammer}, a dwarf sell-sword from \e{Horngrim} who joined the \e{Silverfish Bandits}, but realized it was bad company, and then was almost killed for trying to leave. She and \e{WW} returned to \e{NM}.

Regan learned \e{Shocking Grasp}, tried to test it on \e{Z} as a joke; it didn't go well.

\e{Riley}'s excavation of the Mithril is interrupted by a Golden Gorger, we fled but resolved to return.

\e{Grundle} offerd to help take on the Gorger if we would provide equipment. We succeed in slaying the gorger by a hairsbreadth, expending numerous charges form our magic items in the process; salvaged its hide to make into armor.

\e{Riley} and crew finished excavating the basement. \e{Z} and \e{SF} found a hidden door inside, wade through traps without Rogue assistance, and retrieved \e{Rat's Tooth} from inside a pit dug inside the hidden room.

\e{WW} gave \e{Concluder} to \e{Gareth}, who seemed confident he could re-forge it.  \e{Z} and \e{SF} guarded the mining operation while the others travel to give \e{T} the Gorger hide. We repay the church that resurrected \e{Gregory Riesling} by giving them an enchanted mace. \e{WW} bought a ruby for \e{Concluder}'s hilt.

\e{Z} and \e{SF} ambushed, captured, and interrogated a half-orc near the mine; he admitted the \e{Silverfish Bandits} were hiding out at the Seven Swords Temple. \e{Z} killed him to end his suffering. Then the two rejoined the group; pick up acid-resistant armor \e{T} made from the Wyvern hide.  \e{T} reported that Oerth knights were sent to hunt the dragon in the swamp.

We went to the Seven Swords Temple, slaughtered the \e{Silverfish Bandits}; one Dwarf ran from the area, we pursued him to the road. There, \e{Gil Demair} and his brother \e{Agee} had taken him captive. \e{Gil} invited \e{Kallus} to a tourney soon taking place in \e{Baylith}, and agreed to turn the dwarf, \e{Darren Daggersheen}, over to us.

We questioned \e{Daggersheen}, who admitted being a \e{Silverfish}; lets slip that someone with the last name ``Garret'' in \e{Horngrim} hired them to attack us and that he was headed to \e{Cerena} to meet a human spy.  He then demanded a trial by the Dwarfs, as is customary for his race.

We went to the tourney in \e{Baylith} and participated in all three competitions, but won none. \e{T} completed a suit of armor from the Gorger's hide. Back at the \e{Frothy Jugs}, \e{Philo}'s cousin, \e{Figgins}, sells magical items of dubious origin to \e{Z}.

\B{8 Aug 2012} We met \e{Lord Falcone} at the \e{Frothy Jugs}, who suggested that trouble is brewing, so mercenary help is in high demand; he also implicated the Oerth family in helping draft soldiers into a Givisselian army.  He asked \e{Z} and \e{SF} to join as mercenaries, but we declined; we instead asked for directions to the Falcone family compound so we could join later (really with indent to investigate).

As all the inns were full from the tourney, \e{T} invited us to stay at her townhouse for the night. \e{T} gave Barneby a gift of leather boots with a concealed blade in the toe. She also urged us to further investigate the swamp, as she heard that the dragons had all died or left, leaving the Oerths close to uncovering their ancestor's tomb for unknown (probably nefarious) purpose.

\B{15 Aug 2012} The chill of late fall came; we set out toward the marsh. Few travelers remained other than us, only a group of laborers with empty carts. When questioned, they reported being hired to move earth from a dig site in the swamp.  \e{Barneby} and \e{Suk} disabled their carts to delay them.

Deep in the marsh, a pack of panicked horses nearly trampled us.  \e{WW} calmed one, then \e{SF} shape-shifted into a pony and speak with it; it reluctantly led us near enough to see a black dragon, then left. We fought both it and another of its kind, and with difficulty, defeated both. \e{WW} recovered acid sacs and some scales for armor. We then followed their tracks to their lair, a fascinating construction like a teepee, but made of massive trees rather than sticks; we pilfered their hoard.

\B{22 Aug 2012} We continued to the tomb of \e{Ser Dyson Oerth}, encountering a young girl, \e{Sarsha}, fleeing. In a panic, she tried to cast a sleep spell on us, but then simply fainted. After waking and calming down, she explains that the Oerths planned to sacrifice her in a ritual to open the tomb. \e{Z} then conjured his hut and stayed with \e{Sarsha} while the others headed to the dig site to investigate.

At the tomb, a throng of laborers digging while archers stood guard. Three large tents bore the red-on-black heraldry of house Oerth. \e{Barneby} disguised \e{Suk} as \e{Sarsha}, sending him into the camp.

Meanwhile a worker was dragged from the tomb, screaming, covered in acid, which quickly dissolved armor and flesh alike, killing him. The workers seemed shocked only for a moment, then quickly returned to their work, either too numb or too scared to care. Soon, \e{Elton Oerth} emerges to get \e{Suk} ready for the sacrifice. While \e{WW} caused mass confusion by setting the tents on fire, we stole documents and items from \e{Elton's} tent, then escaped with \e{Suk}; somehow, all without being caught or killed.

\B{5 September 2012} \e{Z} found \e{Elton}'s research on a new spell in the books, a spell likely beyond even the most powerful mortal. Against \e{Z}'s advice, we returned to the tomb; still far out, we saw explosions and flashes of spells, heard screams. Soon after, workmen, horses, and knights alike all came past us, fleeing in panic. Following them came a knight on a dessicated horse, wearing ancient armor and wielding a massive great-sword.

\e{Z} attempted to speak with him, addressing him by name, kissing his signet ring when prompted.  \e{Dyson} only responded that he ``has been summoned.'' \e{Narssisco} attempts to turn undead, but \e{Dyson} resists it and fells \e{Narssisco}. \e{Korvek (K)} attempted to occupy \e{Dyson}, whiel \e{SF} healed \e{Korvek} and \e{Narssisco}, and \e{Z} continued to try diplomacy. After \e{Korvek} too was nearly killed, \e{Dyson} stopped fighting and departed, stated simply that he ``Must go South, to the city by the sea.''

We sent a message to \e{XG}, stating that \e{Dyson} was awake, to warn whomever he saw fit, and to expect us to meet him in person ASAP. We then returned to the tomb to search for clues as to what happened, found one knight left alive. He told us that to open the doors, \e{Elton} ritually sacrificed a young knight possessing magical aptitude. \e{Elton} seemed surprised at \e{Dyson}'s presence, but fought back viciously until hit with \e{Dyson}'s great-sword, when he teleported away. The rest of the Oerths tried to fight, but as they began dying by the dozen, those remaining alive fled.

\B{12 September 2012} In the tomb, \e{SF} found a bronze sculpture of two fiendish figures, strangely sexual in appearance. \e{K} found a loose stone in the floor, and under it, found \e{Dyson}'s +2 ritual dagger.

We returned to \e{Baylith}; \e{T} was happy to find us alive after so many of the Oerth workers returned bearing injuries and stories. \e{T} also had a message for \e{Z}: an invitation from \e{XG} to meet ASAP.

\e{Z} rode ahead to \e{NM} with Sarsha. The rest met group of halfling refugees from outside \e{Horngrim} on the road to Cerena, about sixty in number. They requested permission to settle at \e{NM}. We agreed to give them land to farm and protection, in exchange for service and food. \e{SF} found dead merchants on the road, killed with arrows unique to his presumed-dead tribe.

At \e{NM}, \e{Z} encountered the \e{North Circle} for the first time. \e{Elton} was abrasive, but not hostile. \e{XG} explained \e{Elton} was deceived into opening the tomb: \emph{Elton} expected an artifact, not \e{Dyson}'s wraith.  \e{Zachary} chuckled and quipped ``he has so much power, but not the sense to use it.'' \e{Figgins} explained that those present represent the spellcasters in the North; they seek to identify and educate talent, and to protect the North from aggression. They invited \e{Z} to join them, and although was reluctant to trust \e{Elton}, he accepted. \e{Elton} made his first attempt at helpfulness by explaining the ritual dagger, and suggeting using fire to put \e{Dyson} to rest. He also promised to research the demonic statue in the tomb.  Last, \e{Zachary} gave \e{Z} a Tome of Empowered Sorcel as a welcome gift, before the group departed.

\B{25 September 2012} Miners harvested a cartload of Mithril. \e{Byron Moonglow} requested permission to establish a brewery, we agreed to allow it and obtain materials in exchange for 15\% of profits. \e{NM} was attacked by a hill giant and a pair of ogres; we dispatched them. The halflings requested we train a standing militia for their future protection.

\e{WW} and \e{SF} explored off on their own, coming across a filthy halfling from \e{SF}'s old tribe; they fight and subdue him.

\B{3 October 2012} \e{K} used a potion from \e{Bozzle}'s shop, which granted him regeneration by temporarily changing him into a troll. \e{Z} received news that \e{Zachary} intended to establish an ``Arcane Academy'' in \e{Lindstrom}.

\e{NM} halflings pooled together money to equipment their militia, we went to \e{Cerena} to make the purchases. At \e{Ivek}'s, we bought metal for the brewery, and chanced into \e{Thrane Duran}. He asked us and create a distraction so he can retake a tower from the orcs; we agreed to help in exchange for equipment for the militia. \e{Suk} followed \e{Duran} back to the Dwarven Citadel, to perform for an event. We bought adamantium for \e{Gareth} to work with, then headed to \e{Merkel}'s shop. \e{Merkel} offered us the job of escorting garnets to \e{Horngrim} to trade for black pearls, offered one of the pearls as payment. While in \e{Cerena}, we hear that a group of \e{Horngrim} knights were assaulted on the Merchant's road, and several died.

\e{SF} and \e{WW} found a collection of skulls in a hollowed-out tree near the road, with footprints all around. Nearby, they met a green dragon, \e{Viridian}, and her tribe of Feral halfling worshipers, likely young members of \e{SF}'s tribe who escaped its destruction.

\B{10 October 2012} \e{Z} read his Tome of Brilliant Thought, while \e{Kallus} and \e{Barneby} begin to train the \e{Stout Defenders}. \e{Bruno the Younger} and \e{Harp Moonglow} distinguished themselves as the and best natural leaders.

\e{WW} and \e{SF} continued interacting with \e{Viridian} and eventually convinced the feral halflings to return to \e{NM} with them rather than staying with her. They returned to \e{NM}, and we all set out North toward the Dwarven stronghold. On arrival, we found the tunnel we entered previously had been enlarged by crude workmanship. Inside, we found an ettin and a band of orcs had taken up residence, and defeated them. 

\B{17 October 2012} Further into the stronghold, we encountered a trio of trolls.  \e{Kallus} was slain in the fight, though we ultimately defeated them. \e{Suk} sang of his valor, while the rest grimly moved on. In the jail room, the furthest we entered the stronghold previously, we found stairs leading down, and encountered a rogue-sorcerer, \e{Evan Ridell}, who agreed to join for the protection of numbers.

\B{24 October 2012} At the bottom of the steps, we encountered arcane darkness. By feeling our way around, we found a statue, and upon touching it, the darkness was dispelled: revealing a massive drider guarded by goblinoids bearing maces. We fought and defeated them. Very battered and with neither magic nor vitality remaining in much of a supply, we decided to return to the upper-level to rest.

\B{7 November 2012} \e{Antal} arrived at the stronghold, found the signs of our recent fights. He encountered orcs waiting outside a door, and engaged them. The sound of battle woke the rest of us; we joined the fight. After defeating both the orcs and a naga spellcaster they brought along, we explored more of the upper level of the stronghold, fearing to go below (it may connect all the way through to the underdark). \e{WW} found a secret room; we took a few magic weapons from inside, as well as an \e{Everfull Mug}. 

\B{14 November 2012} Where we previously had fought the ogre mage, we found the orc's quarters, and in a secret compartment there, \e{WW} found a bardic wand. Further in, we encountered a Behir and its retinue of orcs; we defeated them, and harvested scales and electrical glands.  We found a book signed ``Heath'' that detailed a secret trail (not on modern maps) into the wastes that he found some 100 years ago.

\B{28 November 2012} \e{WW} left to train under \e{Matthew Lanliss}, we returned to \e{NM}. \e{Gareth} forged a number of weapons while we were away, including some for sale and some for the militia. In the privacy of \e{Z}'s lab, he nervously presented Concluder, in its completed form.

The feral halflings in \e{NM} have been pestering Grundle, from spying on her to drawing hearts on all her bloomers. \e{SF} found her sharpening her axe, ready to exact her revenge; he tried to calm her and reign in the halfling's behavior. \e{Skel} was the real problem among them, may be beyond reform.

\e{Antal} and \e{Korvek} taught formations, flanking, and other tactics to the \e{Stout Defenders}, and provided them with banners.

\e{Barneby} met \e{Mertensia} (likely Viridian in a new guise), who asked to see \e{Z}; he brings her just after \e{Z} hid \e{Concluder}. She claimed to hail from \e{Horngrim}, but didn't bear their accent. She inquired about \e{Elton}'s books, and seemed to know quite a bit of them. One, she claimed, contained research of a spell never meant for mortals, a ``gift from us to lesser races: \e{Strength of Ages}''. According to her, it requires a dragon to part with power, something a metallic might do, to cristen a champion of good.

\e{Mertensia} went on to claim that the Oerths are is harboring princes in exile from the \e{Denoxian Empire}---a place infamous for its cruel imperialistic expansion.  She also claimed that \e{Elton} tried to make an ally of \e{Corpselight}, but that he is a fool, as that dragon would as likely burn the North to ash as help against the would-be conquerors. Before leaving, she gave \e{Z} a gift, a clear orb, obviously magical, and left \e{Z} to research it. Despite the gifts of information in magic, her motivations remained unclear.

\B{5 December 2012} \e{SF} tasked \e{Skel} and the other ferals with patrolling the woods, though they only seem to see it as permission to kill. He also made them blood--swear to leave \e{Grundle} alone.

\e{Neville} arrived with a letter from \e{XG}: \e{Gil Demair} was killed on the road by an undead horseman; \e{Sarsha} should be sent to the \e{Arcane Academy}. \e{Neville} reported giant tracks near \e{Baylit}h, likely from something driven out of hiding by the Dwarves' recapture of their tower.  \e{Z} stayed in \e{NM} to read \e{Zachary}'s gift and research \e{Mertensia}'s orb; the rest went to hunt the beast outside \e{Baylith}. On the road, they were ambushed by a pair of frost giants. They defeated the giants with the help of a newcomer: \e{Clay}.

\B{12 December 2012} Barneby was grievously injured by giants, but uses a Regen potion and succeeded at shrugging off its deformative effects. Back in \e{NM}, \e{XG} brings a gift to \e{Z}: a ``spell golem'', capable of defending itself from magical assault as a training dummy, and capable of casting preprogrammed array of spells of its own.

Next morning, the first snowfall marked the official beginning of winter.  Party found Clay at his own camp, and asked for him to join.  Further along the road, all encountered \e{XG}'s former apprentice dissecting and storing parts of troll corpses in preservative jars.  Guessed the parts are likely for Bozzle's poritions, but when confronted later, Bozzle seemed genuinely surprised at the ``resurrection'' capacity of his goods.  Clay stole a sample to study further.

\B{6 February 2013} Neville stopped by \e{NM} with news from Seavos County, \e{Horngrim}.  There, the hamlet of \e{Mage's Point} had simply vanished.  We promised to investigate.

Rest of the group headed back to \e{NM}, where the militia had completed training. Once all back together, we headed south to stop by \e{Cerena} and bring a delivery of garnets to \e{Horngrim}, planning to stop and investigate \e{Mage's Point} along the way.  The eventual plan was to continue onward to \e{Givissel}, and inflitrate \e{Lord Falcone}'s estate.

Arriving at the point where the \e{Trade Road} divides Seavos and Malluk Counties, we found massive auras of Necromancy and Trnasmutation around where \e{Mage's Point} once lay. \e{Clay} sensed the whole area and everything in it is evil, but as it was dusk, we had to camp for the night.  In the middle of the night, a scream awoke us, and we see a large half humanoid half vortex floating toward us.

\B{13 February 2013} \e{Antal} laid the killing blow on the wraith after contributing little, and a heavy feeling leaves the area.  On further investigation, we found the central tower of \e{Mage's Point}'s namesake appear under moonlight, and disappear under clouds.  \e{Clay} attempted to knock on the door, but disappeared, and \e{Z} determied he inadventantly traversed a weak point between planes. The rest of us followed, each knocking \e{Clay} back down into the swamppy water, except \e{Z}, who makes it through unscathed. The swamp on the other side was warm, but dark. \e{Z} determined it wasn't an illusion, but likely a pocket plane, with necromantic energy everywhere. We moved toward a town, and found it to be \e{Mage's Point}, apparently somehow transported here.  The villagers were all afraid: they describe the place as eternally night-time, and that their fields and livestock had disappeared, though an unknown force leaves provisions whenever they are needed near the edge of town.  And then, there are the disappearing people near the edge of town, and the dead of the village walking among the living, seemingly not as zombies, but like they had never died.

Near where the provisions appeared, we found tracks leading away from town.  We followed until we found a castle, though before we reached it, encountered a horse and card traveling the other way.  The young woman driver claimed to be a healer heading to town to sell her cures.  She seemed suspicious to most of the party members, so rather than continuing toward the keep, we followed her back, leaving \e{SF} alone to scout nearer the castle.


\B{20 February 2013} \e{SF} encountered the headless undead of our late companion \e{Kallus} further up the road, but he returned unseen.  Back in town, we spoke with the mayor, who asked again for our help returning everyone home, but as we were unsure how to help, we only promise to help stop the disappearances at the edge of town, if we can.

\e{Pellagius} and \e{Sajitz} were traveling together and investigated the missing town like the rest of us, and found the entrance to the shadow realm as well.  The eldest animated-dead woman in town told \e{Pellagius} that he doesn't belong, though he insisted that at age 105, she is the one unlike the rest.  From the shadows nearby, \e{Clay} casts \e{Disrupt Undead} on her, and she charged at him screaming, before simply exploding.  The villagers were stunned by the sudden commotion, but resigned to accept it as they have the rest of their situation.  \e{Pellagius} encourages \e{Clay} to slay more with him, but \e{Clay} denies even knowing how to do such a thing.

The two intestigated a nearby house with a little girl swinging out front, her parents wathcing her, fearful. They told us the girl died months ago, that the ``thing'' wasn't their daughter, really, just as we were no longer really in \e{Mage's Point}.

\e{Z} proposed a plan to hold a feast to use up the town's provisions, thus luring whoever leaves them into a trap.  Meanwhile, \e{Sajitz} suggested torturing the so-called healer, \e{Lena}, for information; \e{Z} angrily suggested \e{SF} is best suited for that sort of work, and stormed off.

The next ``day'' the dead of the town confronted us and demand that we leave them to ``live'' in peace.  We made no concrete promises, but managed to placate them with words, though we were unable to convince any of them that they were truly dead, despite their unnatural ``age'' and inability to remember beyond a week past.  \e{Pellagius} conferred with his deity, and decided the dead aren't animated remains at all, but constructs.

Just as the town began to prepare for the feast, screams came from the edge of town, and we investigated: we found \e{Kallus}' shade-thing near a half--destroyed cottage, just dropping the body of an unconcious girl.  He engaged us with a blue-hued longsword unlike any he owned in life; we dispatch him, and took his armor and sword, which though still magic, no longer glowed.

\B{27 February 2013} \e{Sajitz} stabilized the girl, and \e{Pellagius} saved her father, Cole; their home was utterly destroyed, though.  Cole was unable to guess why they were attacked, but told us a tale of \e{Barnett}, the captain of the guard, driving off a batlike assailant a few nights prior. We rested the night at the mayor's house.

\e{Clay} returned to the family with the dead girl, and offered to destroy her, but they refuse.  After the girl drew a picture for the ``visitor'', depicting \e{Clay} dying horribly, he left.

We set out for the castle. On the road, we encountered a pair of flesh golems, and would have had to run, save for \e{Pellagius}' adamantine weapon.  We freed a prisoner from the nearby gatehouse (Patrick's character), who joined us.  Further along, the swamp receeded, ground became firmer, trees change to evergreen.  We encounter one last traveler on the road, a Night Hag, who warns us that if we fail to slay the lord of the keep, who she claimed is a vampire, that we will never be able to leave. To help, she told us about a drainage hole in the castle wall that could be used to gain entry; then she departed.

\B{6 March 2013} Seeing no guard or any movement on the walls, we entered through the water entrance; the courtyard showed the decay of long neglect, and was scattered with skeletal remains of the inhabitants. \e{Leaf} checked the doors to the keep proper, and finding them unlocked, we proceeded inside.  \e{Korvek} led us up the grand staircase in the foyer, where eight sheilds bearing coat-of-arms adorned the walls; only two were recognizable to us: one bearing House Oerth's morningstar, the other the ancient sheild of a Denoxian legionaire.

The stairs led to a great dining hall, where the sound of a harp emanated softly from an alcove.  Approaching cautiously, we encountered the shade of a weeping elven woman, who led us about the room, showing us her own remains, pinned to the wall by a sword, and two mural tapestries.  The first depicted the dwarven victory over an aggressive lord of \e{Horngrim} some 400 years past.  The next, the execution of a knight, which the shade, in a whispering echo, says is \e{Lord Vostel}, the lord of this keep.  Just then, a figure materialized from the shadows, tall and handwome, ornately armed and armored.  \e{Z} opened with attempted diplomacy, but when Vostel began speaking of feeding on us, we quickly changed tactics.  \e{SF} and \e{Sajitz} delayed the arrival of several minions by filling the entrance hall with darkness and explosions, as we focused on Vostel himself.  After \e{Clay} disarmed him, \e{Korvek} makes short work of him, forcing Vostel to retreat in gaseous form. The Night Hag, who had apparently observed the whole thing, cackled madly with glee at our victory, until \e{Clay} threatened her, and she teleported away. The elven ghost reformed after the battle, and pleads with us to return her remains home, to \e{Lenoria}.

Grabbing Vostel's weapon, we pursued his mist, finding his bones in a tomb defaced with graffiti of \e{traitor!}.  \e{Clay} stopped the vampire from reforming with his magic, while \e{Pellagius} drove a stake through him.  Just before turning to dust, the vampire grabbed \e{Pellagius}, seemingly about to tell him something.  Searching the tomb, we found two magical tomes, and Vostel's enchanted armor. Only moments later, the world around us faded to black, and then was replaced by the chill air of winter; we found ourselves standing in a field outside \e{Mage's Point}, and \e{Bim}, who we nearly knocked over on our arrival, demands to know, ``Where have you been?''
