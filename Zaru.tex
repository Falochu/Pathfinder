\fullline
\noindent Lord Duran arrived at the Outpost, gave permission for us to occupy the area, and promised to recommend our service to Lord Kelvin's Knights, as reward for clearing out the local orcs; suggested future work in taking back more orc-controlled areas in the Mountains (who sometimes hire ogres as mercenaries)\\

\noindent At the direction of Ser Bolton, we agreed to escort Gregory Reisling on his way to Baylith, for negotiations between Painswick and Baylith.  Along the way, we encountered Tristan Moonstone and his escort Shattered Fang seeking a temple from Tristan's dreams. We decided to take a day or two to investigate, and did eventually stumble upon the temple.  Inside we found a statue of the ``Prince of Swords''', named ``Sener Vanis'', mysterious iconography depicting 7 swords, and the broken parts of a sword we named, ``Concluder'', which we took back to Gareth for repairs.\\

\noindent After arriving at Baylith, Reisling was attacked by assassins and killed; we begged a local temple for a resurection spell, which they provided for free, putting us in their debt.  Reisling came back weaker but able to carry on negotiations.  We determined the assassins were from Givissel.  They escape, killing a city guard on the way out.  Whippoorwill follows their tracks south, but we decide not to pursue them further.\\

\noindent Negotiations centered around the ``Thrane Bogs'', a bit of swamppy land owned by the Oerths of Painswick, claimed by Mortimer Thrane of Baylith (after an inter-family marriage gave them some claim).  We investigated to determine why they want a swamp, and found evidence of a green dragon lair and some sort of temple (which there wasn't time to investigate).  We killed a pair of Wyverns on the trip, and hauled back the scales for Trig to work on making armor.\\

\noindent Trig gives Zaru a book, from the library of Lord Givon.  It details the Denoxyan Empire from across the sea, an expansionist culture, and the Empire's fight agains the Estani Barbarians and their ``Sword Coven''. Foreign words \emph{Servain} (prince?) and something possibly meaning "witch" seem connected to the Coven.  May be some connection between this Sword Coven and Gareth's abilities, or with the temple in the forest (of Tristan Moonstone's dreams), or both.  Trig also investigated Miranda's armor, and determined it was made by the armorers of the ``Rikante'' family, and upper-class family of Givissel.\\

\noindent We returned to the Outpost to find it under siege, and tracked troll assailants to a cave, and wipe them out. Inside the cave, we found a vein we later identify as Mithri.\\

\noindent Outpost again attacked, this time by Mercenaries, some bearing the symbol of Azmodeus.  They carried parchment mentioning the ``Dead Man's Arms'' tavern in Horngrim.  After the battle, we took their equipment to town and sold it to the master-at-arms for a large sum of axes.\\

\noindent Zaru recieved a package from Trig of a woodprint of a coat of arms and a knight lying at peace labeled as Ser Dyson Oreth and dated to 800 years ago.  Trig believed it to be his tomb that lies at the center of the hotly-contested Thrane bogs.\\

\noindent We contacted Randall Riley, an expert miner, who determined the ore vein in the old troll cave is Mithiril, and negotiated the rate of 1000gp plus 1.5\% of any profits for extraction, plus a promise to excavate the Outpost's basement for free.\\

\noindent Neville, a Crimson Cloak warned us of the ``Silverfish Bandits'', a group near Turnbull, made up of half-orcs and humans, that was rumored to be have been hired to kill us (by whom and why unknown). Neville also shared rumors of a cult to Azmodeus in Horngrim, and that Givissel was hiring mercenaries from across the sea.\\

\noindent Whippoorwill scouted the road to Horngrim, encounterd a Givisselian caravan under heavy guard, bearing the coat-of-arms of a black candle on a yellow background.  He met Grundle Bolthammer, a dwarf sellsword from Horngrim who joined the Silverfish Bandits, but realized it was bad company, and then was almost killed for trying to leave. She and Whippoorwill returned to the outpost.\\

\noindent Regan learned the new spell Shocking Grasp, and tried to test it on Zaru ``because it's funny''; he progresses as a wizard, but not as a member of non-orcish society.\\

\noindent Randall Riley's excavation of the Mithril is interrupted by the attack of a Golden Gorger, we ran and resolved to return, better prepared.\\

\noindent Grundle offerd to help take on the Gorger in exchange for us providing equipment. We succeed in slaying the gorger by a hairsbreadth, expending numerous charges form our magic items in the process. We salvaged gems and gold from the Gorger's stomach, and take its hide to make into armor.\\

\noindent Randall Riley and crew finished excavating the basement, a 20 by 30 foot area with finished floor and walls, with numerous empty wine racks and casks.  Zaru and Shattered Fang find a hidden door behind a wine rack, wade through a trap without Rogue assistance, and pulled a chest from the bottom of a pit in the next room.  After triggering another trap, we found \emph{Rat's Tooth} inside, a shortsword with a rat's face in the basket hilt.  It is intelligent, and cursed to turn both wielder and targets into were-rats.  \\

\noindent Whippoorwill gave Concluder to Gareth, who seemed confident in his ability to re-forge it while retaining its magical properties. Zaru and Shattered Fang guard the mining operation while the others travel to give Trig the Gorger hide, and to repay the church that resurrected Gregory Riesling, by giving them an enchanted mace. Whippoorwill buys a ruby for Gareth to set in Concluder's hilt. Zaru and Shattered Fang ambushed and killed a half-orc at the mining camp, captured another and interrogated him, revealing that the Silverfish bandits are hiding out at the Seven Swords Temple. Zaru kills the prisoner to save him from suffering, and the two meet back up with the party, and pick up newly completed acid-resistant armor Trig made from the Wyvern hide.  She passes on info that Oerth men-at-arms were sent into the swamp but never returned, and now knights are hunting the dragon (the younger one may have left already).\\

\noindent Neville reported that the mercenaries that were coming for us tried to ambush a Oerth caravan, took heavy losses, and so won't likely be a threat anymore.  He also offered to give us trustworthy contacts in Horngrim, if we decide to go there.\\

\noindent We go to the Seven Swords Temple, and slaughtered the Silverfish Bandits, one Dwarf, possibly not a Silverfish himself, escaped to the road back to Cerena. We pursued him, and encounter two knights of Demair (a Horngrim family) who had taken him captive. The knights, Agee and Gil (brothers), invite Kallus to the tournament taking place soon in Baylith, and agree to turn the dwarf, Darren Daggersheen, over to us.\\

\noindent We questioned Daggersheen, who admits to being a Silverfish and an outcast from Dwarven society, and claimed that someone with the last name ``Garret'' was the one sending the Silverfish out against us from Horngrim and Givissel. He also claimed to be headed to Cerena to meet a human spy (wouldn't give a name).  Other than that, he claimed to have no information, and demanded a trial by the Dwarfs, as he comes from a dwarven noble family.\\

\noindent We went to the tourney in Baylith and participated in all three competitions, but won none of them. Kallus met Samuel Riesling, older brother to our friend Gregory.  Met Dr.\ Bernard Bozzle, the Alchemist who has opened up shop across from Trig; he sells all manner of potions, but something seemed fishy about his operation, not the least of which was that he sells healing potions that do not draw from a divine source.  Trig completed a suit of armor from the Gorger's hide. Back at the Frothy Jugs, Philo's cousin, Figgins, tried to sell numerous magical items to Shattered Fang and Zaru, but they were overpriced and his claims of their power were questionable. Still, Zaru decided to buy scrolls of Ice Storm and Mage's Sword, which a \emph{Read Magic} showed will work (though the scroll wording is archaic).\\

\noindent \textbf{8/8} A Givisselite came in to the Frothy Jugs just as Zaru completed his transaction.  He was guarding a fat, moustached man who introduced himself as Lord Falcone, a `Factor' in Givissel who hires mercenaries from all over---even as far away as the Dutchy of Korvain.  He implied that hiring is going up as there might be some sort of war coming, and he stated that his hosts ``here in the north'' (the Oerth family) are drafting soldiers into the Givisselian army for him.  Falcone wanted to recruit Zaru and Shattered Fang and ``useful little people'' to help. Zaru asked for directions to the Falcone family compound so he can join the effort, though he really indended to infiltrate and investigate at a later time.\\

\noindent The rest of the party met Trig, who invited us all to stay at her townhouse for the night, as all the inns were full from the tourney.  Everyone met up at the Frothy Jugs, then went to Trig's.  There, she gave Barneby a gift: a pair of leather boots with a concealed blade in the toe. She also urged the party to go back to the swamp and investigate further: rumor had it that the dragons have all been taken out of the equation, and now the Oerths are close to uncovering their ancestor's tomb, perhaps hoping to uncover an artifact he left behind.\\

\noindent \textbf{8/15} We set out at the next dawn, a cool fall day (perhaps 50 degrees), and headed toward the marshes.  Travelers thinned until only one other group remained other than us: a group of laborers with empty carts.  They said they were hired for a day to move earth from a dig site in the swamp.  Barneby and Suk disabled their carts, and we continued on.  We stopped near the center of the marsh and got off the road just in time to avoid being trampled by a pack of panicked horses.  Whippoorwill tries to calm them, and nearly got trampled, but did succeed.  Shattered Fang used wild shape to become a pony and speak with the horse, who agreed to show us what had him so spooked.  He lead us to a black dragon, and then departed in a hury.  We fought, and soon the dragon was reinforced by another.  With some difficulty (but not nearly as much as the gorger) we defeat both, and Whippoorwill butchers them, recovering their acid sacs, and enough intact scales to make a small piece of armor, perhaps boots or a shield.  Whippoorwill followd their tracks to their lair, a fascinating construction like a teepee, but made of massive trees rather than branches.  Inside we found an assortment of magic items and numerous gold axes and silver anvils.\\

\noindent \textbf{8/22} As the late fall dusk turned to night, we went from the lair to the tomb of Ser Dyson Oerth, and encountered a 12-year-old girl, Sarsha, fleeing the dig site. She at first tried to cast a sleep spell on us, but then simply fainted. When she woke, she claims the Oerths planned to sacrifice her in a ritual to open the tomb, so she escaped.  Zaru conjured his hut and stayed to keep her safe while the others go to the dig site to investigate. They found over 100 laborers un-burying the tomb, guarded by numerous crossbowmen and archers, and found three large tents bearing the Oerth red-on-black heraldry.  Barneby disguised Suk as Sarsha, and sent him in her place. Meanwhile a worker was dragged from the tomb, screaming, covered in acid, which quickly dissolved armor and flesh alike, killing him.  The workers seem shocked at first, but then quickly return to their routine, as if accustomed to such events.  Soon, Elton emerges to get Suk ready for the sacrifice.  We enact a bold plan to steal from Elton's tent while Whippoorwill causes mass confusion by setting the tents on fire, and escape with Suk.  Somehow, it works, and the party brings the haul back to Zaru at the Tiny Hut.\\

\noindent Elton's spellbooks contain (in the first): Chill Touch, Magic Weapon, Magic Missile, Color Spray, Detect Undead, Detect Secret Doors, True Strike, and Mage Armor;  (in the second): Create Undead, Undeath to Death, Chain Lightning, Acid Fog, Greater Dispell Magic, Symbol of Pain, Dominate Person, Nightmare, Circle of Death, Black Tentacles, Crushing Despair, Summon Monster IV, Phantasmal Killer, Locate Creature, Bestow Curse, Detect Scrying, Animate Dead, Teleport, and Cloudkill.\\

\noindent \textbf{9/5} Zaru discovered that Elton was researching a new spell, and had made notes in his books.  The magic appeared to be very difficult and complex, even beyond the normal reach of a mortal.  Against Zaru's advice, we went back towards the tomb; still fifteen minutes out, we saw explosions and flashes of lightning spells, and heard screams.  Soon after, the workmen's carts came rushing away from the site, worker, horse, and knight alike fleeing.  Finally, following in a seemingly calm manner came an undead knight on a dissicated horse, wearing ancient armor and wielding a greatsword larger than we had ever seen.\\

\noindent Zaru attempted to speak with him, naming him Ser Dyson Oerth, and kissing his signet ring when prompted.  Dyson would only respond that he ``has been summoned.'' Narssisco attempts to turn undead, but Dyson resists it and fells Narssisco in a single strike.  In a panic, most of us fled, while Korvek attempted to delay Dyson, Shattered Fang attempted to heal Korvek and Narssisco, and Zaru continuted to attempt to speak with Dyson.  After Korvek too was struck within a hairsbreadth of oblivion, Dyson stated simply that he ``Must go South, to the city by the sea,'' seemingly to complete the task for which he was summoned.  Zaru then told him to go, and ignore the party; wether by his own volition, Zaru's words, or magic compulsion, he departed.\\

\noindent After reviving our unconscious companions, we sent an animal messenger to Xander Grey, stating that Ser Dyson Oerth was awake, to warn whomever he saw fit, and to expect us to meet him in person as soon as we were able.  We then returned to the tomb to search for clues as to what happened, and encountered one knight of Oerth, seemingly in shock.  He told us that Elton sacrificed a young Oerth knight of some magical aptitude, one ``Renyard,'' in a ritual to open the tomb doors.  Elton seemed surprised that Dyson attacked him, but fought back viciously until run through with Dyson's greatsword; he simply disappeared after.  The rest of the Oerths and workers tried to fight, but it was soon clear they stood no chance, so those remaining alive fled.  Inside the tomb we encountered lesser undead and dispatched them, and found a cache of magical items: bracers of armor +2, +1 chainmail of jousting (grants +5 to remain in the saddle when jousting), +1 cold resist 10 breastplate, 3 javelins of lightning, +1 keen dwarven waraxe, a large steel shield of the champion (paladin only, grants +2 to AC versus a chosen opponent), and bracers of the falcon's aim (grants bonuses as \emph{Aspect of the Falcon} spell).\\
