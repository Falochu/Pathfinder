\textbf{[Early Campaign]} At the \emph{Frothy Jugs}, a tavern in the Northern town of \emph{Cerena}, a group of young adventurous spirits form a party to go forth into Dwarven territory in the high mountains, and put an end to the terror and banditry that the Orcs have visited upon the local people. The party consists of \emph{Zaru (Z)}, a gnomish wizard from the nearby town of \emph{Lindstrom}, \emph{Gavin}, an outcast half-elf would-be knight in these predominantly human lands, \emph{Whippoorwill (WW)}, a quiet and decisive Ranger of the nearby forest, \emph{Hifos}, a mad barbarian from the wastes of the far north, and \emph{Wren}, a local cleric.\par
Following the lead of \emph{WW}'s tracking skill, they set out after the latest raiding party, eventually coming across an abandoned Dwarven outpost, where they encounter the orcs, and slay them.  Inside the main building, they free three former prisoners: \emph{Philo Fixtell}, a halfling bard, \emph{Trig}, a halfling leatherworker, and \emph{Gareth}, a half-orc blacksmith, with the mysterious skill to produce weapons with magical qualities, though he has no skill in the arcane arts in any traditional sense.\par
After resting and resupplying, the adventurers make their way further into the mountains, where they clear out more orcs, an ogre sorcerer, and their beasts. Taking a daring step, \emph{Z} decides to free yet another prisoner, this one an orc of the tribe itself, though a cowardly, outcast one.  \emph{Regan}, a frail (by orcish standards) but intelligent (again, by orcish standards) orc promises loyalty in exchange for protection, and becomes \emph{Z}'s apprentice. Not daring to go any further into the mountain tomb, where likely worse things than orcs reside, the adventurers return to the Dwarvish outpost, and begin to consider claiming it as their own home.\\

\noindent\textbf{[Sessions prior to August 2012]} \emph{Lord Duran} arrived at \emph{NM}, gave permission to occupy the area; promised to recommend us to \emph{Lord Kelvin}, as reward for clearing out the local orcs; suggested future work in taking back more orc-controlled areas in the Mountains. \par
At the direction of \emph{Ser Bolton}, we agreed to escort \emph{Gregory Reisling} on his way to \emph{Baylith}, for negotiations between \emph{Painswick} and \emph{Baylith}.  Along the way, we encountered \emph{Tristan Moonstone} and his escort \emph{SF} seeking a temple from Tristan's dreams. We detour to investigate; eventually we stumbled upon the temple.  Inside we found a statue of the ``Prince of Swords'', mysterious iconography depicting 7 swords, and the broken parts of \emph{Concluder}, which we took back to \emph{Gareth} for repairs.\par
After arriving at \emph{Baylith}, \emph{Reisling} was attacked by assassins and killed; we begged a local temple for a resurection spell, which they provided. We determined the assassins were from Givissel. They had already left, killing a city guard on the way out.  \emph{WW} found their tracks leading south, but we decided not to pursue.\par
Negotiations begin concerning the \emph{Thrane Bog}, a bit of swamp owned by the Thranes of \emph{Baylith}, and claimed by the Oerths of \emph{Painswick}, after an inter-family marriage.  We investigated why they want a swamp, and found evidence of a dragon lair and some sort of temple, but didn't have time to determine which if either was important.  We killed a pair of Wyverns on the trip, and hauled back the scales for Trig to work on making armor.\par
\emph{Trig} gave \emph{Z} a book, detailing the \emph{Denoxian Empire}. It lead us to suspect some connection between a ``Sword Coven'' that was wiped out there a long time ago, and Gareth's abilities. The coven also bears resemblance to the temple of \emph{Tristan Moonstone}'s dreams). Trig also investigated Miranda's armor, and determined it was made by the armorers of the \emph{Rikante family}, of Givissel.\par
We returned to \emph{NM} to find it under siege. After routing the troll assailants, tracking them to a cave, and wiping them out, we found an ore vein we later identify as Mithri.\par
\emph{NM} again attacked, this time by Mercenaries, some bearing the symbol of Azmodeus.  They carried parchment mentioning the ``Dead Man's Arms'' tavern in Horngrim.  After the battle, we took their equipment to town and sold it to the master-at-arms for a large sum of axes.\\

\noindent \emph{Z} recieved a package from Trig of a woodprint of a coat of arms and a knight lying at peace labeled as Ser Dyson Oreth and dated to 800 years ago.  Trig believed it to be his tomb that lies at the center of the hotly-contested Thrane bogs.\\

\noindent We contacted Randall Riley, an expert miner, who determined the ore vein in the old troll cave is Mithiril, and negotiated the rate of 1000ax plus 1.5\% of any profits for extraction, plus a promise to excavate \emph{NM}'s basement for free.\\

\noindent Neville, a Crimson Cloak warned us of the ``Silverfish Bandits'', a group near Turnbull, made up of half-orcs and humans, that was rumored to be have been hired to kill us (by whom and why unknown). Neville also shared rumors of a cult to Azmodeus in Horngrim, and that Givissel was hiring mercenaries from across the sea.\\

\noindent Whippoorwill scouted the road to Horngrim, encounterd a Givisselian caravan under heavy guard, bearing the coat-of-arms of a black candle on a yellow background.  He met Grundle Bolthammer, a dwarf sellsword from Horngrim who joined the Silverfish Bandits, but realized it was bad company, and then was almost killed for trying to leave. She and Whippoorwill returned to \emph{NM}.\\

\noindent Regan learned the new spell Shocking Grasp, and tried to test it on \emph{Z} ``because it's funny''; he progresses as a wizard, but not as a member of non-orcish society.\\

\noindent Randall Riley's excavation of the Mithril is interrupted by the attack of a Golden Gorger, we ran and resolved to return, better prepared.\\

\noindent Grundle offerd to help take on the Gorger in exchange for us providing equipment. We succeed in slaying the gorger by a hairsbreadth, expending numerous charges form our magic items in the process. We salvaged gems and gold from the Gorger's stomach, and take its hide to make into armor.\\

\noindent Randall Riley and crew finished excavating the basement, a 20 by 30 foot area with finished floor and walls, with numerous empty wine racks and casks.  \emph{Z} and Shattered Fang find a hidden door behind a wine rack, wade through a trap without Rogue assistance, and pulled a chest from the bottom of a pit in the next room.  After triggering another trap, we found \emph{Rat's Tooth} inside, a shortsword with a rat's face in the basket hilt.  It is intelligent, and cursed to turn both wielder and targets into were-rats.  \\

\noindent Whippoorwill gave Concluder to Gareth, who seemed confident in his ability to re-forge it while retaining its magical properties. \emph{Z} and Shattered Fang guard the mining operation while the others travel to give Trig the Gorger hide, and to repay the church that resurrected Gregory Riesling, by giving them an enchanted mace. Whippoorwill buys a ruby for Gareth to set in Concluder's hilt. \emph{Z} and Shattered Fang ambushed and killed a half-orc at the mining camp, captured another and interrogated him, revealing that the Silverfish bandits are hiding out at the Seven Swords Temple. \emph{Z} kills the prisoner to save him from suffering, and the two meet back up with the party, and pick up newly completed acid-resistant armor Trig made from the Wyvern hide.  She passes on info that Oerth men-at-arms were sent into the swamp but never returned, and now knights are hunting the dragon (the younger one may have left already).\\

\noindent Neville reported that the mercenaries that were coming for us tried to ambush a Oerth caravan, took heavy losses, and so won't likely be a threat anymore.  He also offered to give us trustworthy contacts in Horngrim, if we decide to go there.\\

\noindent We go to the Seven Swords Temple, and slaughtered the Silverfish Bandits, one Dwarf, possibly not a Silverfish himself, escaped to the road back to Cerena. We pursued him, and encounter two knights of Demair (a Horngrim family) who had taken him captive. The knights, Agee and Gil (brothers), invite Kallus to the tournament taking place soon in Baylith, and agree to turn the dwarf, Darren Daggersheen, over to us.\\

\noindent We questioned Daggersheen, who admits to being a Silverfish and an outcast from Dwarven society, and claimed that someone with the last name ``Garret'' was the one sending the Silverfish out against us from Horngrim and Givissel. He also claimed to be headed to Cerena to meet a human spy (wouldn't give a name).  Other than that, he claimed to have no information, and demanded a trial by the Dwarfs, as he comes from a dwarven noble family.\\

\noindent We went to the tourney in Baylith and participated in all three competitions, but won none of them. Kallus met Samuel Riesling, older brother to our friend Gregory.  Met Dr.\ Bernard Bozzle, the Alchemist who has opened up shop across from Trig; he sells all manner of potions, but something seemed fishy about his operation, not the least of which was that he sells healing potions that do not draw from a divine source.  Trig completed a suit of armor from the Gorger's hide. Back at the Frothy Jugs, Philo's cousin, Figgins, tried to sell numerous magical items to Shattered Fang and \emph{Z}, but they were overpriced and his claims of their power were questionable. Still, \emph{Z} decided to buy scrolls of Ice Storm and Mage's Sword, which a \emph{Read Magic} showed will work (though the scroll wording is archaic).\\

\textbf{8 Aug 2012} We met \emph{Lord Falcone}, a `Factor' in Givissel who hires mercenaries for his city, at the Frothy Jugs.  He suggested that trouble is brewing, so mercenary help is in high demand; he also implicated the Oerth family in helping draft soldiers into a Givisselian army.  He asked \emph{Z} and \emph{SF} to join as mercenaries, but we declined; we instead asked for directions to the Falcone family compound so we could join later (really with indent to infiltrate and investigate).\par
As all the inns were full from the tourney, \emph{Trig} invited us to stay at her townhouse for the night. Trig gave Barneby a gift of leather boots with a concealed blade in the toe. She also urged us to further investigate the swamp, as she heard that the dragons had all died or left, leaving the Oerths close to uncovering their ancestor's tomb for unknown (probably nefarious) purpose.\\

\textbf{15 Aug 2012} The next day dawned with the cool of fall, and we set out toward the marsh. Few travelers remained other than us, only a group of laborers with empty carts. When questioned, they reported being hired to move earth from a dig site in the swamp.  Barneby and Suk disabled their carts to delay them.\par
Deep in the marsh, we were nearly trampled by a pack of panicked horses.  \emph{WW} calmed one, then \emph{SF} shape-shifted into a pony and speak with it; it reluctantly agreed to show us what had him so spooked.  After leading us near enough to see a black dragon, it departed in a hurry. Unable to escape notice, we fought both it and another of its kind, and with difficulty, defeated both. \emph{WW} butchered the corpses, recovering both acid sacs and some intact scales for armor. \emph{WW} then followed their tracks to their lair, a fascinating construction like a teepee, but made of massive trees rather than sticks. Inside, we pilfered an assortment of magic items and coins.\\

\textbf{22 Aug 2012} That night, we continued from the lair to the tomb of \emph{Ser Dyson Oerth}, encountering a young girl, \emph{Sarsha}, fleeing not unlike the horses from earlier. In a panic, she tried to cast a sleep spell on us, but then simply fainted. After waking and calming down, she explains that the Oerths planned to sacrifice her in a ritual to open the tomb. \emph{Z} then conjured his hut and stayed with \emph{Sarsha} while the others headed to the dig site to investigate.\par
At the tomb, a throng of laborers was excavating the tomb, while archers stood guard. Three large tents bore the red-on-black heraldry of house Oerth. \emph{Barneby} disguised \emph{Suk} as \emph{Sarsha}, sending him into the camp. Meanwhile a worker was dragged from the tomb, screaming, covered in acid, which quickly dissolved armor and flesh alike, killing him. The workers seemed shocked only for a moment, then quickly returned to their work, either too numb or too scared to care. Soon, \emph{Elton Oerth} emerges to get \emph{Suk} ready for the sacrifice. While \emph{WW} caused mass confusion by setting the tents on fire, we stole documents, books, and even magic items from \emph{Elton's} tent, then escaped with \emph{Suk}; somehow, all without being caught or killed.\\

\noindent \textbf{9/5} \emph{Z} discovered that Elton was researching a new spell, and had made notes in his books.  The magic appeared to be very difficult and complex, even beyond the normal reach of a mortal.  Against \emph{Z}'s advice, we went back towards the tomb; still fifteen minutes out, we saw explosions and flashes of lightning spells, and heard screams.  Soon after, the workmen's carts came rushing away from the site, worker, horse, and knight alike fleeing.  Finally, following in a seemingly calm manner came an undead knight on a dissicated horse, wearing ancient armor and wielding a greatsword larger than we had ever seen.\\

\noindent \emph{Z} attempted to speak with him, naming him Ser Dyson Oerth, and kissing his signet ring when prompted.  Dyson would only respond that he ``has been summoned.'' Narssisco attempts to turn undead, but Dyson resists it and fells Narssisco in a single strike.  In a panic, most of us fled, while Korvek attempted to delay Dyson, Shattered Fang attempted to heal Korvek and Narssisco, and \emph{Z} continuted to attempt to speak with Dyson.  After Korvek too was struck within a hairsbreadth of oblivion, Dyson stated simply that he ``Must go South, to the city by the sea,'' seemingly to complete the task for which he was summoned.  \emph{Z} then told him to go, and ignore the party; wether by his own volition, \emph{Z}'s words, or magic compulsion, he departed.\\

\noindent After reviving our unconscious companions, we sent an animal messenger to Xander Grey, stating that Ser Dyson Oerth was awake, to warn whomever he saw fit, and to expect us to meet him in person as soon as we were able.  We then returned to the tomb to search for clues as to what happened, and encountered one knight of Oerth, seemingly in shock.  He told us that Elton sacrificed a young Oerth knight of some magical aptitude, one ``Renyard,'' in a ritual to open the tomb doors.  Elton seemed surprised that Dyson attacked him, but fought back viciously until run through with Dyson's greatsword; he simply disappeared after.  The rest of the Oerths and workers tried to fight, but it was soon clear they stood no chance, so those remaining alive fled.  Inside the tomb we encountered lesser undead and dispatched them, and found a cache of magical items. \\

\noindent \textbf{9/12} SF found a bronze sculpture of two fiendish figures, male and female; it was strangely sexual in appearance. Korvek found a loose stone in the floor, and under it finds a +2 dagger, that \emph{Z} determines probably belonged to Oerth.  It is a Oerth rite of passage for a boy to recieve a dagger at his entrance to manhood.  \\

\noindent We returned to Baylith.  Encountered Xander Gray's red-haired young apprentice, spewing anti-gnomish slurs, at Dr. Bozzle's apothecary.  She and Barneby flirted.  Barneby nearly ignores her companion, a young man named Miles, of a weathy farming family in Meredith. Trig was happy to find us alive after so many of the Oerth workers returned bearing injuries and terrible stories.  Trig delivers a message to \emph{Z}, which a house Gray squire left in her care.  It invites \emph{Z} to meet with Xander Gray as soon as possible, at his tower.  We stayed the night at Trig's.\\

\noindent \emph{Z} rides ahead to \emph{NM} on his phantom steed, with Sarsha. The rest met a traveling group of halfling clans on the road to Cerena, 63 in all. Their leaders explained that they were looking for us.  They were displaced from near Horngrim, and want to settle at \emph{NM}.  Among them were Bruno Fixtell (a blacksmith), Bellis Bluebottle (an adept), Hallus Littlefoot (a farmer), and Byron Moonglove (a brewer).  We agreed to give them 5 acres to farm, and protection, in exchange for service and food.  SF discovered that one of his tribesmen may yet live, as he found an arrow unique to his tribe, used only recently to kill merchants on the road.\\

\noindent \emph{Z} arrived at \emph{NM} to find a group of mages had teleported there only recently: Elton Oerth, Xander Gray, \emph{Z}'s uncle, Zachary, Nanny Oggle (a renown witch from Haverton), and Figgins Fixtell are all sitting around waiting for him. Elton turns out to be abrasive, but not dangrous. Xander explains that Elton was deceeved into opening the tomb, and expected an artifact, not Dyson's wraith.  Zachary chuckled at Elton's discomfort, and quipped ``he has so much power, but not the sense to use it.'' Figgins takes over explaining that the group represents the most powerful spellcasters in the North, and that they seek to identify and educate younger talent, as well as to protect the North from Givisselian aggression.  Although \emph{Z} was reluctant to trust Elton, the others vouched for him.  They invited \emph{Z} to join the group, and he accepted.  Elton then told \emph{Z} that the ritual dagger will be particularly effective against Dyson Oerth (acting as a +4 and ignoring his piercing DR), and that his shade should furthermore be vulnerable to fire.  Elton also promises to research and report back about the demonic statue in the tomb.  Soon after trading that information, the wizards departed, save Zachary, who stayed long enough to give \emph{Z} a gift: a Tome of Empowered Sorcel.  A few hours later, the rest of the party arrived back at \emph{NM}. \\

\noindent \textbf{9/25} Miners finished harvesting a cartload of mithril, 150lbs of unrefined ore, which they expected to yield 50 pounds after smelting. Kallus took 6 of the 150 pounds to make a new sword.  Byron Moonglove met us to ask for permission to establish a brewery.  We agreed to obtain the required copper sheeting and help set up in exchange for 15\% of the profits. We prepared to head to Cerena to purchase equipment, but before departing, were called to defend the halflings from a hill giant and a pair of ogres.  We dispatched them, but the halflings became nervous, and request we train a standing militia for their future protection. \\

\noindent WW and SF explored off on their own, coming across a disgusting barbarian wearing the armor of SF's old tribe.  They fight and defeat him, ending his ability to tarnish the tribe's memory. \\

\noindent \textbf{10/3} Korvek was the first to try a potion from Dr. Bozzle's shop, which granted him regeneration by temporarily changing him into a troll. \\

\noindent \emph{Z} recieved word that Zachary intended to establish an ``Arcane Academy'' in Lindstrom, with the assistance of Philo.  The halflings pooled together money for us to purchase equipment for their new militia, then we went to Cerena, visiting Merkel the Jeweler and Ivek the armorer.  At Ivek's, \emph{Z} bought 6 large sheets of copper, and ran into Thrane Duran and two guards.  He asked \emph{Z} to take his group (us) and create a distraction so the dwarves can retake a tower from the orcs, 4 days hence. \emph{Z} agreed to help, in exchange for 12 of each dwarven-crafted chain shirts, handaxes, and small shields (for the militia), and 4 potions of cure serious wounds (for us).  The Thrane then promised to meed us at \emph{NM} in 2 weeks to follow up.  Before leaving Ivek's, \emph{Z} also bought 25 pounds of adamantium for only 900 axes, using some aggressive persuasion tactics (using Ivek's oathbreaker status and hatred of the Thrane against him).  Over at Merkel's jewelery shop, we obtained a promise of a black pearl for Kallus' sword, in exchange for guarding a wagon to Horngrim laden with garnets for trade: to depart two weeks hence. While in town, we heard that a group of Horngrim knights were assaulted on the Merchant's road, and several died. \\

\noindent Suk heads to the Dwarven Citadel, about a day-and-a-half ride from \emph{NM}, to perform at a dinner event. \\

\noindent SF and WW found a collection of skulls in a hollowed-out tree near the road, with footprints all around.  Shah-yur suddenly warned that something invisible was watching them all.  After investigating, they met a green dragon, named Viridian, and her tribe of Feral halfling worshipers, possibly members of SF's tribe.  WW and SF try to convince them to return to \emph{NM}, but weren't successful. \\

\noindent \textbf{10/10} \emph{Z} read his Tome of Brilliant Thought, while Kallus and Barneby trained the halfling militia (and gave it a name: The Stout Defenders). On the 3rd day before our scheduled departure into the mountains, Bruno the Younger (of the Fixtell clan) distinguished himself as one of the strongest trainee.  Harp Moonglow showed potential with finesse weaponry, as well as natural leadership qualities.  \\

\noindent On their separate excursion, WW and SF continued interacting with Viridian and trying to get the feral halflings to return to \emph{NM} with them.  \\

\noindent For our impending excursion, Bellis Bluebottle prepared six cure light wounds potions, and six cure moderate wounds potions.  WW and SF arrived home just in time to join us on the journey North.  On the scheduled morning, in the cold of early winter, we set out toward the old Dwarven stronghold.  The tunnel we entered previously had been enlarged by crude workmanship, probably orcish.  Inside, we found an ettin and a band of orcs had taken up residence, and defeated them. Suk finds a magic staff and a ring on a magic-using orc sorceress. \\

\noindent \textbf{10/16} We delved further into the stronghold, and found a huge store of provisions, likely looted from nearby caravans.  In the storeroom, we found a magic coin mounted to a necklace: a coin of luck, which we gave to Suk.  Behind a closed double-door, we encountered a trio of trolls.  We fight valiantly, and ultimately defeat them, but not before Kallus is slain to a massive series of hits in a short period of time. Suk vows to sing of his valor, and the rest of us grimly prepare to move on.  In the jail room, the furthest we entered the stronghold previously, we find stairs leading down, and we began to descend\ldots \\

\noindent \textbf{10/25} Just before we descend, we encountered a rogue-sorcerer who had been sneaking about since before we arrived, named Evan Ridell. For the benefit of protection in numbers, he agreed to join us.  At the bottom of the steps, the darkness transforms from natural to arcane in nature.  Blind but able to feel our way around, we found a statue, and upon touching it, the darkness was dispelled: revealing a massive half-spider half-elf abomination guarded by goblinoids bearing maces. We fight and defeat them, this time without mortal casualties. Very battered and with neither magic nor vitality remaining in much of a supply, we decided to loot quickly and return to the upper-level storeroom to rest and recover.  \\

\noindent \textbf{11/7} A Halfling Cavalier from Horngrim, named Antal, arrived at the stronghold, riding his war dog.  He cautiously explored, taking note of the recent destruction left in our wake.  While exploring, he encountered orcs waiting outside the storeroom door, and decided to engage them.  His battle cry roused the rest of us to come join the fight, where we struggled against not just orcs, but also a naga spellcaster.  After eventually defeating them all, we explored further on the upper level of the stronghold, fearing to delve too deep: we began to suspect that the stronghold may connect all the way through to the underdark.  WW found a secret door, and behind it, an armory.  Inside, we located a few magical weapons, and a very large supply of mundane ones (6 dwarven waraxes, 10 battle axes, 20 hand axes, 6 warhammers, 6 light hammers, 20 shortswords, 20 crossbows, 20 large steel shields, 20 small steel shields, and 20 helms), as well as a brass adorned silver mug bearing the image of a drinking dwarf: which we determined to be an \emph{Everfull Mug}, capable of filling itself up to five times a day upon command. \\ 

\noindent \textbf{11/14} After setting a trap to warn of intruders, we went to clear the remainder of the main level.  Where we had previously fought and defeated the ogre mage, we found the orc's home, filled with filthy animal skin beds.  Under a bed, WW finds a secret compartment holding a bardic wand.  In another room further in, we encountered a Behir---a blue-scaled reptile with six legs and curved horns---and its retinue of orcs.  After dispatching them, WW and SF harvested the scales to make armor, and its glands---which may be processed into ink, able to grant a +1 to each die of a lightning bolt spell scroll. On a bookshelf in the room, we discovered a book signed ``Heath'', who claims to have located a trail into the wastes over 100 years ago; the trail does not appear on any modern map known to us. \\

\noindent\textbf{11/28} WW left to train under Matthew Lanliss in Stenwick.   Gareth, meanwhile, presented his accomplishments from while we have been away: 9 masterwork longswords, 1 of which was enchanted. In addition, 1 enchanted bastard sword, and 10 halfling shortswords (2 of them magic), for the militia. Finally, in the relative privacy of \emph{Z}'s lab, he nervously presented Concluder, in its completed form.  \\

\noindent The feral halflings in \emph{NM} have been pestering Grundle, from spying on her to drawing hearts on all her bloomers. SF found her sharpening her axe, ready to exact her revenge.  SF tried to calm her, and then reign in the halfling's behavior.  It seemed that Skel was the real problem among them, the other three merely a filthy eyesore.  \\

\noindent Antal and Korvek continued training the militia, teaching formations, flanking, and other tactics, and providing them with banners.\\

\noindent Barneby met a beautiful woman who introduced herself as ``Mertensia'', but was likely Viridian in a new guise; she asked to see \emph{Z}. Barneby brings her into the lab just after \emph{Z} hid Concluder.  She claimed to hail from Horngrim, but didn't bear their accent.  She inquires whether I have Elton's books, and seems to know quite a bit of them.  ``If you happen to have one in particular,'' she said, ``you might find his research of a certain spell that was never meant for him---a gift from us to lesser races.'' She went on to detail the spell, ``Strength of Ages'', stating that it required a dragon to part with its power, something the likes of Corpselight would never do, but a metallic might, to cristen a champion of good.  She claimed she wishes us to win, wants only the best for us, but she obviously had her own agenda in lending support.  She implied that a certain merchant house is harboring princes in exile from the Denoxian Empire---a place infamous for its cruel imperialistic expansion.  She also claimed that Elton tried to make an ally of Corpselight, but that he is a fool, as that dragon would as likely burn the North to ash as help against the would-be conquerors. Before leaving, she gave \emph{Z} a gift, a clear orb, obviously magical, and left \emph{Z} to research it.\\

\noindent\textbf{12/5} SF again spoke with the feral halflings, but had trouble keeping their attention.  He tasked them with patrolling the woods, though they only seem to see it as permission to kill. He also made them blood--swear to leave Grundle alone.\\

\noindent Neville arrives with a message from Xander Gray, stating that Gil Demair (a knight we met at the tourney) was killed on the road, reportedly by an undead horseman. It also inquired about sending Sarsha to the Arcane Academy.  Neville himself reported giant tracks near Baylith, likely from something driven out of hiding by the Dwarves' recapture of their tower.  \emph{Z} stayed in \emph{NM} to study his Tome of Empowered Sorcel, while the rest went to help hunt the beast outside Baylith. \emph{Z} also studied the orb given by Mertensia, with Regan's help.  Regan learned to fire it, but it causes pain to do so: the orb does not have charges, but instead feeds on its wielder's life force.  It can fire up to 5 bolts of arcing lightning up to 100 feet, each dealing d10+2 damage on a touch attack.  Firing 1 bolt saps only 1 hp, 2---5hp, 3--10hp, 4--15hp, and 5--20hp.  On the Road to Baylith, as SF examines the tracks, the party was ambushed by their makers: a pair of frost giants, which they defeated with the help of a newcomer: Clay Blackpool (Jeremy).  \\

\textbf{12 December 2012} Barneby was grievously injured by giants, but uses a Regen potion and succeeded at shrugging off its deformative effects. Back in \emph{NM}, \emph{XG} brings a gift to \emph{Z}: a ``spell golem'', capable of defending itself from magical assault as a training dummy, and capable of casting preprogrammed array of spells of its own.\par
Next morning, the first snowfall marked the official beginning of winter.  Party found Clay at his own camp, and asked for him to join.  Further along the road, all encountered \emph{XG}'s former apprentice dissecting and storing parts of troll corpses in preservative jars.  Guessed the parts are likely for Bozzle's poritions, but when confronted later, Bozzle seemed genuinely surprised at the ``resurrection'' capacity of his goods.  Clay stole a sample to study further. \\

\textbf{6 February 2013} Neville stopped by \emph{NM} with news from Seavos County, \emph{Horngrim}.  There, the hamlet of \emph{Mage's Point} had simply vanished.  We promised to investigate.\par
Rest of the group headed back to \emph{NM}, where the militia had completed training. \emph{Harp Moonglow} and \emph{Bruno the Younger} became 2nd level fighters, and the other 18 militia, 1st level warriors. Once all back together, we headed south to stop by \emph{Cerena} and bring a delivery of garnets to \emph{Horngrim}, planning to stop and investigate \emph{Mage's Point} along the way.  The eventual plan was to continue onward to \emph{Givissel}, and inflitrate \emph{Lord Falcone}'s estate.\par
Arriving at the point where the \emph{Trade Road} divides Seavos and Malluk Counties, we found massive auras of Necromancy and Trnasmutation around where \emph{Mage's Point} once lay. \emph{Clay} sensed the whole area and everything in it is evil, but as it was dusk, we had to camp for the night.  In the middle of the night, a scream awoke us, and we see a large half humanoid half vortex floating toward us.\\

\textbf{13 February 2013} \emph{Antal} laid the killing blow on the wraith after contributing little, and a heavy feeling leaves the area.  On further investigation, we found the central tower of \emph{Mage's Point}'s namesake appear under moonlight, and disappear under clouds.  \emph{Clay} attempted to knock on the door, but disappeared, and \emph{Z} determied he inadventantly traversed a weak point between planes. The rest of us followed, each knocking \emph{Clay} back down into the swamppy water, except \emph{Z}, who makes it through unscathed. The swamp on the other side was warm, but dark. \emph{Z} determined it wasn't an illusion, but likely a pocket plane, with necromantic energy everywhere. We moved toward a town, and found it to be \emph{Mage's Point}, apparently somehow transported here.  The villagers were all afraid: they describe the place as eternally night-time, and that their fields and livestock had disappeared, though an unknown force leaves provisions whenever they are needed near the edge of town.  And then, there are the disappearing people near the edge of town, and the dead of the village walking among the living, seemingly not as zombies, but like they had never died.\par
Near where the provisions appeared, we found tracks leading away from town.  We followed until we found a castle, though before we reached it, encountered a horse and card traveling the other way.  The young woman driver claimed to be a healer heading to town to sell her cures.  She seemed suspicious to most of the party members, so rather than continuing toward the keep, we followed her back, leaving \emph{SF} alone to scout nearer the castle.\\

\textbf{20 February 2013} \emph{SF} encountered the headless undead of our late companion \emph{Kallus} further up the road, but he returned unseen.  Back in town, we spoke with the mayor, who asked again for our help returning everyone home, but as we were unsure how to help, we only promise to help stop the disappearances at the edge of town, if we can.\par
\emph{Pellagius} and \emph{Sajitz} were traveling together and investigated the missing town like the rest of us, and found the entrance to the shadow realm as well.  The eldest animated-dead woman in town told \emph{Pellagius} that he doesn't belong, though he insisted that at age 105, she is the one unlike the rest.  From the shadows nearby, \emph{Clay} casts \emph{Disrupt Undead} on her, and she charged at him screaming, before simply exploding.  The villagers were stunned by the sudden commotion, but resigned to accept it as they have the rest of their situation.  \emph{Pellagius} encourages \emph{Clay} to slay more with him, but \emph{Clay} denies even knowing how to do such a thing.\par
The two intestigated a nearby house with a little girl swinging out front, her parents wathcing her, fearful. They told us the girl died months ago, that the ``thing'' wasn't their daughter, really, just as we were no longer really in \emph{Mage's Point}.\par
\emph{Z} proposed a plan to hold a feast to use up the town's provisions, thus luring whoever leaves them into a trap.  Meanwhile, \emph{Sajitz} suggested torturing the so-called healer, \emph{Lena}, for information; \emph{Z} angrily suggested \emph{SF} is best suited for that sort of work, and stormed off.\par
The next ``day'' the dead of the town confronted us and demand that we leave them to ``live'' in peace.  We made no concrete promises, but managed to placate them with words, though we were unable to convince any of them that they were truly dead, despite their unnatural ``age'' and inability to remember beyond a week past.  \emph{Pellagius} conferred with his deity, and decided the dead aren't animated remains at all, but constructs.\par
Just as the town began to prepare for the feast, screams came from the edge of town, and we investigated: we found \emph{Kallus}' shade-thing near a half--destroyed cottage, just dropping the body of an unconcious girl.  He engaged us with a blue-hued longsword unlike any he owned in life; we dispatch him, and took his armor and sword, which though still magic, no longer glowed.\\

\textbf{27 February 2013} \emph{Sajitz} stabilized the girl, and \emph{Pellagius} saved her father, Cole; their home was utterly destroyed, though.  Cole was unable to guess why they were attacked, but told us a tale of \emph{Barnett}, the captain of the guard, driving off a batlike assailant a few nights prior. We rested the night at the mayor's house.\par
\emph{Clay} returned to the family with the dead girl, and offered to destroy her, but they refuse.  After the girl drew a picture for the ``visitor'', depicting \emph{Clay} dying horribly, he left.\par
We set out for the castle. On the road, we encountered a pair of flesh golems, and would have had to run, save for \emph{Pellagius}' adamantine weapon.  We freed a prisoner from the nearby gatehouse (Patrick's character), who joined us.  Further along, the swamp receeded, ground became firmer, trees change to evergreen.  We encounter one last traveler on the road, a Night Hag, who warns us that if we fail to slay the lord of the keep, who she claimed is a vampire, that we will never be able to leave.  She then showed us a postern gate entrance, and departed.  \\\\\\
